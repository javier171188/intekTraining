        <p id="text">"Lisa the Vegetarian" is the fifth episode in the seventh season of the American animated television series The Simpsons.[3] It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 15, 1995.[1] In the episode, Lisa decides to stop eating meat after bonding with a lamb at a petting zoo. Her schoolmates and family members ridicule her for her beliefs, but with the help of Apu as well as Paul and Linda McCartney, she commits to vegetarianism.
            Directed by Mark Kirkland, "Lisa the Vegetarian" is the first full-length episode David S. Cohen wrote for The Simpsons. David Mirkin, the showrunner at the time, supported the episode in part because he had just become a vegetarian himself. Former Beatle Paul McCartney and his wife Linda guest star in the episode; their condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series. The episode makes several references to McCartney's musical career, and his song "Maybe I'm Amazed" plays during the closing credits.
            In its original broadcast, "Lisa the Vegetarian" was watched by 14.6 million viewers[4] and finished 47th in the ratings for the week of October 9â€“15, 1995, with a 9.0 Nielsen rating. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week.</p>
